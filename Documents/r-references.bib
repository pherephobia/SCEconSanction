abstract = { The democratic peace literature has focused primarily on militarized conflict; however, aspects of the democratic peace may influence how states use economic sanctions. This article investigates how democracies sanction both each other and other non-democracies. Because economic sanctions are very different from military force, some aspects of the democratic peace, such as the more peaceful nature of democracies, do not apply to the decision to sanction. However, several democratic peace factors should influence the use of economic sanctions, such as institutional constraints, shared values, and quick resolutions often found between two democracies. Using upyeard economic sanction data from 1978 through 2000, the article employs rare-event logit analysis to show that the democratic peace does influence the use of economic coercion - democracies are less likely to sanction each other. It also shows that democracies employ sanctions more than other regime types, in part because democracies pursue human rights and democratization goals with economic sanctions. The results further reveal that unlike other countries, the United States is not hesitant to sanction its allies. }

abstract="One prominent explanation for the failure of economic sanctions is that they usually fail to impose significant economic penalties upon domestic groups powerful enough to change the policies of the target government. Interestingly, this was not true in one of the most important cases of economic sanctions, the British and UN sanctions against Rhodesia from 1965 to 1979. Central to these sanctions, which were intended to pressure Rhodesia's white minority government to accept eventual majority rule in this central African colony, was a boycott of the colony's tobacco exports. Tobacco accounted for 10 per cent of Rhodesia's GDP and 34 per cent of its export earnings in the year before the boycott. The colony's tobacco growers were also the single most powerful economic interest group in Rhodesian politics, strongly organised into the Rhodesian Tobacco Association (RTA) and well placed to influence government policy. Not only did the colony's political institutions systematically over-represent the colony's white agricultural and rural interests, so too did the structure of the colony's ruling political party, the Rhodesian Front (RF), which had strong ties to the colony's agricultural regions. As a result, the growers were widely regarded as the single most important constituency of the RF government (see Galtung, 1967, p. 396; Arnold and Baldwin, 1972, p. 6; Bowman, 1973, p. 116).",

    abstract = { While economic sanctions are widely believed to be ineffective policy instruments, their use has increased in recent years. Scholars have analyzed the question of sanction effectiveness, but few have approached the conditions that lead to their employment. This article addresses that question: what conditions lead a country to initiate economic sanctions? Focusing on the U.S., both the relations with the target country and the domestic political and economic conditions in America are considered as factors leading to the imposition of economic sanctions. Time-seriescross-section data from 50 countries between 1966-1992 show that the president considers both the relations with the target and American domestic factors when deciding to initiate economic sanctions. However, the relationship with the target is the largest stimulus to sanction use, while the domestic factors only marginally influence the decision. The analysis highlights the importance of economic sanctions as a form of coercive diplomacy aimed at the target and not a White House reaction to domestic demands for action. }
